For parts 2 and 3 for each question after question 1, I used the clean text as the document label. I figured this was fine as it will correctly identify the document, but I understand that it might be a bit hard to follow. Additionally, for each part 3 (test data query), I used the test vocab as the query. The results should still be accurate, but I think I misunderstood what it was asking at first. Entire program takes about 4 minutes to run.
